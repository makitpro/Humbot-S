We recommend unplugging the servos before loading the programs because they may cause load action to fail.
 

These programs are used by Humbot Sargantana robot to perform different actions.
Here you have two important tips about the code.

First: remember that we give you this programa to make it easy for you to play with 
the robot but we encourage you to modify it and try new things. You can
modify every line of the code but we indicate you some lines that
are easier to change. You will see that these zones are surrounded by 
several hashtags (########################) and EASY MODIFICATION ZONE text.

Second: To perform some actions, there are some portions of code that are surrounded by comments like this next one:
//---Start of LED extra siren------------------  
const int redLED_pin = 2;   //Red LED 
const int greenLED_pin = 3;   //Green LED 
const int blueLED_pin = 4;   // Blue LED
//---End of LED extra siren--------------------
This code is an extension to the main program. The main function will work without this portions.
We give you two programs, with and without these parts. It's up to you to use one or another or to modify them at your convenience.
